## Vision

The E-Library Smart Contract is designed to create a decentralized platform where authors can publish their educational resources and students can access them securely. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform ensures that authors are fairly rewarded for their work while maintaining the integrity and ownership of their content. The system offers discounts to students who frequently access resources, promoting educational growth at a lower cost.

## Features

- **Admin**: The admin registers authors and students, sets reward amounts, and manages funds within the contract.
- **Author**: Authors can add resources to the library and receive rewards for contributing.
- **Student**: Students can purchase and access resources, with discounts provided for frequent usage
```

### Flow Description

1. **Admin Role**:
    - Registers authors and students.
    - Sets reward amounts for authors.
    - Deposits and withdraws funds from the contract.

2. **Author Role**:
    - Adds resources to the library.
    - Receives rewards when a resource is added.

3. **Student Role**:
    - Purchases resources from the library.
    - Receives discounts based on the number of resources purchased.
    - Views the content of purchased resources.
